# Contributing

This is a collection of CONTRIBUTING file templates. It's officially inspired
in [github/gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore) initiative.

Some years ago Github has written about
[Contributing Guidelines in its blog](https://github.com/blog/1184-contributing-guidelines)
presenting CONTRIBUTING files and recommending PRs in repositories without it.
It seems to be a strong evidence that in *Open Source* ecossystem this is an  important policy to set.

However when you're starting something *open sourced* you don't know exactly
what points are important to mention in this kind of document. It happens with
licenses, for example, and it was well solved by http://choosealicense.com.

It happens with `.gitignore` files as well and was well solved with, already mentioned, [github/gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore) project. The
first CONTRIBUTING sample comes from [gulpjs/gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
repository which looks really great and complete for me.

Help us adding more samples!
